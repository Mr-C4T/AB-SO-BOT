## 🔩 Modular Design

AB-SO-BOT is built using a combination of 3D-printed parts and 40mm aluminum extrusions to create a flexible and modular body for the SO-ARM100 robotic arm (https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100 ❤️).
This modularity allows for easy customization, expansion, and adaptation for different robotic applications.
